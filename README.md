## Welcome to Listado de Personas, my second fullstack project featuring Java, Springboot and Angular! ðŸš€

Listado de Personas is a very simple web app that manages users that are allocated in an SQL database, and serves them using Springboot, JPA and Angular.

In this project, I kept the scope small and simple to prioritize building a clean Angular structure. My primary focus was to deeply understand the interaction between Angular components, routing, and HTTP requests, and to ensure a seamless flow of data between the frontend and backend. This approach allowed me to solidify my knowledge of Angular's core concepts and best practices.

Join me as I continue to increase my Angular experience with more projects!
