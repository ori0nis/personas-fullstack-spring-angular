## Welcome to Listado de Personas, my second fullstack project featuring Java, Springboot and Angular! ðŸš€

Listado de Personas is a very simple web app that manages users that are allocated in an SQL database, and serves them using Springboot, JPA and Angular.

In this particular project, I focused on keeping things small and simple to prioritize getting used to create a solid Angular structure. I also wanted to fully understand how the flow between routes, components and HTTP requests works.

Join me as I continue to increase my Angular experience with more projects!
